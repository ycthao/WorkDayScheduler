# Work Day Scheduler #

Create an day scheduler for an employee to use to organize their work day, assuming that their work day is a regular 9 AM to 5 PM business hours.  The app will run in the brower.

## How it works ##

When open, the current day is at the top of the calendar.
When scrolling down, time blocks are presented for standard 9 AM to 5 PM business hours.
When viewing time blocks, each time blocked is color-coded to indicate wether it is past, present or future.
When clicking a time block, we can enter an event.
When clicking saved button, then the even is saved in the local storage.
When refreshing the page, the saved events still shows up.
