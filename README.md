# Work Day Scheduler #



## How it works ##

When open, the current day is at the top of the calendar.
When scrolling down, time blocks are presented for standard 9am to 5pm business hours.
When viewing time blocks, each time blocked is color-coded to indicate wether it is past, present or future.
When clicking a time block, we can enter an event.
When clicking saved button, then the even is saved in the local storage.
When refreshing the page, the saved events still shows up.
